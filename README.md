#SliverAppBar

#Key features of SliverAppBar include:

Customizable Heights: Adjust the expanded and collapsed height of the app bar.
Pinned: Keeps the app bar visible at the top of the screen during scrolling.
Floating: Enables the app bar to appear as soon as the user scrolls up.
Snap: Snaps the app bar into place when scrolling stops (used with floating).
FlexibleSpace: Allows adding flexible content (like images, titles, or gradients) that adjusts during scrolling.
Integration with CustomScrollView: Works seamlessly with other slivers in a CustomScrollView....
