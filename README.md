SliverAppBar: A Customizable App Bar for Scrollable Views
The SliverAppBar widget in Flutter provides a flexible and dynamic app bar that adjusts seamlessly with scrolling. It's part of the Sliver family and works in combination with scrollable widgets like CustomScrollView to enhance user interface design.

Key Features:
Customizable Heights: Set different heights for the expanded and collapsed states of the app bar.
Pinned: Keeps the app bar fixed at the top of the screen during scrolling.
Floating: Makes the app bar reappear immediately when the user scrolls upward.
Snap: Automatically snaps the app bar into position when scrolling stops (requires floating).
FlexibleSpace: Add dynamic content, such as images, titles, or gradients, that adjusts smoothly during scrolling.
Integration with CustomScrollView: Seamlessly combines with other slivers for building advanced scrolling layouts.
Typical Use Case:
The SliverAppBar is ideal for creating modern, engaging UI designs, such as collapsible headers, animated app bars, or scrollable image banners.
